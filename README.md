# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from LeetCode. I solve these problems using Python and update this repository with solutions to daily challenges as well as some popular questions.
This repo also includes questions I have solved so far from [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a platform for learning and improving coding skills with a focus on problem-solving. It provides a collection of coding challenges that can help prepare for technical interviews.


## About Me

I'm a passionate coder who enjoys problem-solving and algorithmic challenges. I believe in continuous learning and improvement.

## Repository Structure

Each problem has its own solution file is a Python (.py) file. The name of the file is the same as the problem title on LeetCode.

## Usage

Feel free to use this repository for reference. To run any solution, navigate to the problem directory and run the Python file.

```sh
python3 problem_name.py
```

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal use, contributions or suggestions are welcome.

You can create a new file named `README.md` in your repository and paste the above content into it. Replace `problem_name.py` with the actual name of your Python solution file. You can also replace the "About Me" section with your own personal introduction.
